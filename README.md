##The website uses the following software, thank them ~

* The project adopts a design that separates the front and back ends.
* The front-end uses VUE V3.
* The back-end of Silicon Valley server uses Laravel 10
* The back-end of Shanghai server uses CodeIgniter 4
* The database is MySQL 8.0.
* Use Tencent Cloud CDN service to speed up access.
* Domain name load balancing technology is used. Traffic within China goes through Tencent Cloud's Shanghai server, and traffic outside China goes through Tencent Cloud's Silicon Valley server.
* Regularly go to the official BWF website to capture the ranking data of players.
* Use bootstrap to ensure that computers, mobile phones, and tablets can display normally.
* Simple multi-language function, you can switch between Chinese and English.
